## How to Successfully Execute in a Contract, Functions that SHOULD be there but are not

Since the advent of the "Stable Coins" a whole silent revolution has been unleashed in the world of new financial technologies.

For strong security and resilience reasons in the logistics of operation, any contract that manages a stable coin must include a strategy of "upgradeability".

In the case at hand, we will devote our attention to three emerging relevance currencies: [True-USD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000085d4780b73119b644ae5ecd22b376#code), [USD-Coin](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48#code) and [EURO-Stasis](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdb25f211ab05b1c97d595516f45794528a807ad8#code) and we will unravel their magical performance.

When comparing the lines of code of these contracts with the [standard](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/ERC20) that an ERC20 token must meet, we may be unpleasantly surprised that they have little or nothing to do with the expected code.

For example, the "totalSupply" function, which is a mandatory method in any ERC20 token, is absent in every line of code in both the [True-USD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000085d4780b73119b644ae5ecd22b376#code) contract and the [USD-Coin](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48#code) code too.

Other essential functions such as the "transfer" one or the balance inquiry of each user are absent as well.

How can, therefore these currencies operate and why traditional wallets, such as Metamask, have no problem executing transactions with them?
